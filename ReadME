# AI-Driven Autonomous and Adaptive Firewall

An intelligent, self-learning network security system that leverages Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning to detect and mitigate cyber threats in real-time without human intervention.

## About

The **AI-Driven Autonomous and Adaptive Firewall** is a next-generation security solution designed to overcome the limitations of traditional static firewalls. Conventional security measures often fail against dynamic threats like zero-day attacks, polymorphic malware, and sophisticated DDoS offensives. This project integrates a hybrid Machine Learning model (combining Autoencoders, LSTM, and Random Forest) with a Reinforcement Learning-based decision engine.

Unlike traditional systems, this firewall acts as an "intelligent security analyst." It continuously monitors network traffic, identifies anomalies, and autonomously updates blocking rules using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controllers. This ensures the network evolves alongside changing threat landscapes, providing robust protection for enterprise and cloud environments.

## Features

* **Hybrid AI Detection:** Utilizes Random Forest and 1D-CNN models to analyze packet headers and payloads for precise threat detection.
* **Autonomous Rule Adaptation:** Implements Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) to automatically update firewall rules based on real-time feedback.
* **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** Identifies zero-day attacks and behavioral anomalies using unsupervised learning techniques (Autoencoders).
* **SDN Integration:** leverages Software-Defined Networking (OpenFlow/Ryu) for dynamic policy enforcement and instant mitigation.
* **Automated Response Engine:** Instantly executes actions such as IP blocking, port isolation, or rate limiting upon threat detection.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides real-time visualization of traffic, threat alerts, and system status via a Streamlit/Flask UI.

## Requirements

* **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu recommended) or Windows 10/11 (64-bit).
* **Hardware:** Minimum 8GB RAM, Multi-core processor, and 50GB Storage.
* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x.
* **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn (for model training and inference).
* **SDN Controller:** Mininet with Ryu or OpenFlow controller.
* **Web Framework:** Flask or Streamlit (for the dashboard UI).
* **Packet Processing:** Scapy library for packet parsing and feature extraction.
* **Additional Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data processing and visualization.

## Results and Impact

The AI-Driven Autonomous and Adaptive Firewall significantly enhances network security by shifting from reactive to proactive defense. The system successfully demonstrates the ability to detect complex intrusion patterns, including SQL injections and DDoS attacks, with high accuracy. By automating the mitigation process through Reinforcement Learning and SDN, the system minimizes human dependency, reduces false positives, and ensures a self-healing security infrastructure capable of withstanding modern cyber threats.
